the Client (as referred in this document), is a non-profit organization that serves 53,000 students across 21 US states by providing a stipend each month for the students to choose their own books out of the Scholastic catalogue. 
Our research initiated some diverse arenas for visualization and implemented an amalgamation of the ideations through visualizations as final deliverables. We collected dataset(s) from Client, and processed data for preparation, and transformation; this was followed by data analysis, including dataset(s) summary and descriptive statistics on key business metrics of Client business model. 
The data analysis insights were leveraged to build multi-dimensional dynamic visualizations on Tableau, including location analysis, pareto analysis, value analysis, word cloud comprising Client served states, and etc.,. 
We also designed a temporal bar graph entailing top book titles using Sci2 open source tool.
